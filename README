                      Net::Telnet, version 3.00

    Copyright (c) 1997 Jay Rogers. All rights reserved.  This program
    is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
    the same terms as Perl itself.


  Prerequisite
  ------------

    .  Perl Version 5.002 or later

    .  Windows 95/NT requires Perl beta version 5.003_07 or later

    .  No modules are required that don't already come with a
       standard distribution of Perl.


  Description
  -----------

    Net::Telnet allows you to make client connections to a TCP port
    and do network I/O, especially with a port using the TELNET
    protocol.  Simple I/O methods such as print, get, and getline are
    provided.  More sophisticated interactive features are provided
    because connecting to a TELNET port ultimately means communicating
    with a program designed for human interaction.  Some interactive
    features include the ability to specify a timeout and to wait for
    patterns to appear in the input stream, such as the prompt from a
    command interpreter.

    This example prints who's logged-on to the remote host sparky:

        $sparky = new Net::Telnet (Host => "sparky",
                                   Timeout => 10,
                                   Prompt => '/[$%#>] $/');
        $sparky->login($username, $passwd);
        @lines = $sparky->cmd("/usr/bin/who");
        print @lines;
        $sparky->close;

    Other reasons to use this class than strictly with a TELNET port
    are:

        .  You're not familiar with sockets and you want a simple
           way to make client connections to TCP services.

        .  You want to be able to specify your own time-out while
           connecting, reading, or writing.

        .  You're communicating with an interactive program at the
           other end of some socket or pipe and you want to wait for
           certain patterns to appear.

    Examples are contained in the POD user documentation.

    This is an alpha version - meaning that the interface may change
    in future versions.  Contact me, Jay Rogers <jay@rgrs.com>, if you
    find any bugs or have suggestions for improvement.


  Documentation
  -------------

    User documentation in POD format is contained in the module.
    Installing using "make" places a man page in the perl library
    under directory "man/man3".


  Installation
  ------------

    .  To install, cd to the directory containing the unpacked
       distribution and do one of the following:

        a.  Create a makefile by running Makefile.PL using the perl
            whose library you want to install into and then running
            make:

                perl Makefile.PL
                make test
                make install

        b.  To install into an alternate library, set the "prefix"
            argument where you want to install.  You can ignore any
            errors mentioning perllocal.pod.  For example:

                perl Makefile.PL prefix=~/local
                make test
                make install

        c.  Alternatively, you can just copy or move Telnet.pm
            from the distribution into a directory named Net in the
            Perl library.
